# A fireside chat with the IRAS bot. It reads:

Me: I am a permanent-resident earning $50,000 income. What is my tax rate?

Bot: You may refer to the table below for the Resident income tax rates from YA 2017 to YA 2023.
 
  Do note that the tax rates are applied on the chargeable income. 
   
  Chargeable income = (Total taxable income - allowable expenses - approved donations - personal reliefs)
  (translation options)
  
  To achieve greater progressivity, the top marginal personal income tax rate will be increased with effect from YA 2024.

  You may refer to the table below for resident income tax rates from YA 2024:

  (other tabular data)


Me: I am blind. I cannot see tabular data. Can you tell me through text?

Bot: Sorry. I didn't catch that. Would you like to rephrase your question?

    Here are some tips:
    
    ✔ Ask your question in a single message. Keep it short and concise.
    
    ✔ Include keywords in your questions e.g. How to pay tax via GIRO

## I have concluded something. IRAS bot is weak. And fragile. And pathetic. 

We must be better

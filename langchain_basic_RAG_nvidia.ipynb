augmenting LLM knowledge with additional data.\n","- LLMs can reason about wide-ranging topics, but their knowledge is limited to the public data up to a specific point in time that they were trained on.\n","- If you want to build AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a model's cutoff date, you need to augment the knowledge of the model with the specific information it needs.\n","- The process of bringing the appropriate information and inserting it into the model prompt is known as retrieval augmented generation (RAG).\n","\n","The preceding summary of RAG originates in the LangChain v0.2 tutorial [Build a RAG App](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/tutorials/rag/) tutorial in the LangChain v0.2 documentation.\n","\n","#### NIM\n","\n","- [NIM microservices](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-nim-offers-optimized-inference-microservices-for-deploying-ai-models-at-scale/) are containerized microservices that simplify the deployment of generative AI models like LLMs and are optimized to run on NVIDIA GPUs.\n","- NIM microservices support models across domains like chat, embedding, reranking, and more from both the community and NVIDIA.\n","\n","#### NVIDIA API Catalog\n","\n","- [NVIDIA API Catalog](https://build.nvidia.com/explore/discover) is a hosted platform for accessing a wide range of microservices online.\n","- You can test models on the catalog and then export them with an NVIDIA AI Enterprise license for on-premises or cloud deployment\n","\n","#### langchain-nvidia-ai-endpoints\n","\n","- The [`langchain-nvidia-ai-endpoints`](https://pypi.org/project/langchain-nvidia-ai-endpoints/) Python package contains LangChain integrations for building applications that communicate with NVIDIA NIM
